**_Cost Estimation_**

The file I created is a cost estimation program that calculates the general cost of a project (office building or hotel building) so a construction firm can have a quick idea of what is the construction cost and the possible amount of profit.

So, I created a program where you would be able to calculate the cost of construction of a hotel or an office space in New York. The program will give you three options for the cost index of the construction of the project low, median and high. By providing the cost index you select, the building type, the floors of the building, and the square footing you get the cost of the construction. After you get the cost, the program adds the overhead of the project, the profit and bonding of the project getting you the final cost estimated offer.
